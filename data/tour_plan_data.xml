                                                <nts:gea>Driving and Sightseeing Day 1Tour the highlights of the Golden Circle and the start of the South Coast on your way to Vík:https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wn7LMuod3cVnz3NWANORWAY: Europeans love driving in Norway and during the summer months, the more popular tourist roads becomes crowded with European vans. This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                            <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                        <!-- Service Category -->

However, East Iceland is normally not associated with geothermal heat and considered a cold spot. This makes Vök Baths an even more unique attraction. Throughout the centuries, people living around Lake Urriðavatn noticed certain spots on the lake that curiously did not freeze during winter. The Icelandic name given to these ice-free patches is “Vök” (plural Vakir).The warm water flowing from the ground at Urriðavatn lake is so pure that it is the only geothermal water in Iceland certified as drinkable.

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                    <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                    <!-- Service Category -->

The hunt takes you out of town to the countryside, away from the bright lights of the city so that the Northern Lights can be seen in all their beauty and colours. The local guide will share Icelandic tales during the journey on this magical tour. Please note the Northern Lights are a natural phenomenon and are also dependant on weather conditions therefore it is not possible to guarantee they will be sighted however if the guide confirms no lights were seen, you will be offered a free retry the next day if the tour is running.

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                                <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                                        <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                                                    <!-- Service Category -->

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                                                                <!-- Service Category -->

Other possible sightings are Sei, Pilot whale plus dolphins and porpoises. This unique trip takes us into the waters where ocean giants swim in the shadow of the magnificent Snæfellsjökull Glacier, searching around the Snæfellsnes peninsula. Nowhere else in Iceland is there a better change to see toothed-whales such as orcas, sperm whales and pilot whales than along this beautiful coastline. The orcas are more often seen in winter and early in the summer, during April and June, but there is a chance of seeing them all the way through the summer months. Male sperm whales can be seen especially in June in deeper water. Other whales that can be seen are humpback whales and minke whales as well as white-beaked dolphins. We get as close as we can without disturbing the whales while we enjoy the spectacle of them feeding and playing.NOTE: Subject of weather conditions.Meeting point: Ólafsvík, Snæfellsnes PeninsulaDuration: Approx 3 hoursBring with you: Warm clothingMin persons on the tour: 4Departure: 1st April to 14th June & 20th Aug to 15th Sept at 13:00.

The on-site bathhouse is made from salvaged timbers from the area. Even the hooks in the changing room are repurposed horseshoes from a nearby family farm. The Húsafell locals who undertook the Canyon Baths project went to great lengths to keep the entire structure as environmentally unobtrusive, sustainable and true to the area’s heritage as possible.Hiking to the bathsLed by a knowledgeable local guide, this year-round tour begins with a short ride from the Hotel Húsafell to the trailhead in the remote Icelandic Highlands. On this 2-hour tour we enjoy a relaxed walk among natural wonders not found in many guidebooks, including the spectacular two-tiered waterfall Langifoss. We’ll also learn about Iceland’s renewable energy practices, cross an icy stream of glacial meltwater and see the site to Okjökull, Iceland’s first glacier claimed by climate change.The highlight of our excursion is a serene soak in the recently completed Húsafell Canyon Baths, a surreal hot spring paradise that has to be seen to be believed.

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you’re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.</Description>                                                                                                                                                                    <!-- Service Category -->
