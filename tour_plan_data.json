The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you\u2019re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice.

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you\u2019re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.",

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you\u2019re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.",

Other possible sightings are Sei, Pilot whale plus dolphins and porpoises. This unique trip takes us into the waters where ocean giants swim in the shadow of the magnificent Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull Glacier, searching around the Sn\u00e6fellsnes peninsula. Nowhere else in Iceland is there a better change to see toothed-whales such as orcas, sperm whales and pilot whales than along this beautiful coastline. The orcas are more often seen in winter and early in the summer, during April and June, but there is a chance of seeing them all the way through the summer months. Male sperm whales can be seen especially in June in deeper water. Other whales that can be seen are humpback whales and minke whales as well as white-beaked dolphins. We get as close as we can without disturbing the whales while we enjoy the spectacle of them feeding and playing.NOTE: Subject of weather conditions.Meeting point: \u00d3lafsv\u00edk, Sn\u00e6fellsnes PeninsulaDuration: Approx 3 hoursBring with you: Warm clothingMin persons on the tour: 4",

The on-site bathhouse is made from salvaged timbers from the area. Even the hooks in the changing room are repurposed horseshoes from a nearby family farm. The H\u00fasafell locals who undertook the Canyon Baths project went to great lengths to keep the entire structure as environmentally unobtrusive, sustainable and true to the area\u2019s heritage as possible.Hiking to the bathsLed by a knowledgeable local guide, this year-round tour begins with a short ride from the Hotel H\u00fasafell to the trailhead in the remote Icelandic Highlands. On this 2-hour tour we enjoy a relaxed walk among natural wonders not found in many guidebooks, including the spectacular two-tiered waterfall Langifoss.

This can slow the roads down, as it can be difficult to pass these vans. Norwegian country roads are often quite narrow. Having said this, these roads are incredibly scenic and have lots of picnic & photo spots. If you are going to be using ferries during your drive, depending on the size of the ferry, this might involve a wait to get on. The ferries are reliable and regular but you may need to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. On some of the ferries, consider catching a ferry outside of the peak times. Your accommodation hosts will have the most up to date local information on hand so ask them for suggestions for your following days travel.ICELAND: In regards to gravel roads; technically you\u2019re not recommended to take a hire car on gravel roads, but in Iceland you may not have a choice. Some guesthouses are located on gravel roads. Consider getting extra car insurance with gravel protection if it is something that might worry you.",
