Ekeberg Restaurant: lovely location with views of Oslo - also great for lunch combined with a walk in the Ekeberg Sculpture Park Castello: located on the waterfront at S\u00f8renga near the Opera and Munch Museum. Sommerro has a great rooftop restaurant TAK (roof). You can find all on-site restaurant in this link. Breakfast is served in the Ekspedisjonshallen. Rest: The name means \u201cleftovers\u201d and Chef Jimmy \u00d8ien and his team are working towards a zero-waste philosophy that also involves using ingredients that no one else wants and turn it into a beautiful high-class manu. Kontrast: Swedish chef Mikael Svensson is cooking New Nordic food his own way and that has earned the restaurant a Michelin star three years in a row. Smalhans: a neighbourhood restaurant open from lunch to dinner and the only restaurant in Norway with a Bib Gourmand rating in the Michelin guide. Sentralen: Norwegian brasserie-style food: simple and modern and using local ingredient, also home of Hitchhiker Restaurant and the rooftop terrace Mynt. Two great international options: Ling Ling Oslo, a Cantonese restaurant with a rooftop terrace and Plah, a modern Thai cuisine & airy, upscale bar for street food, plus leafy terrace.For more suggestions, please see our attractions page: https://www.fiftydegreesnorth.com/eu/attractions/restaurant-options-in-oslo",

The train runs through spectacular scenery, alongside the Rallar Road, vertiginous mountainsides, foaming waterfalls, through 20 tunnels and offers so many viewpoints that, for many people, a single trip up and down is not enough. National Geographic Traveler Magazine calls the Fl\u00e5m Railway one of the top 10 train journeys in Europe while in 2014 Lonely Planet Traveller went even further, and named it the best train journeys in the world.",
